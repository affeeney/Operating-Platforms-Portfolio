# Operating-Platforms-Portfolio
The Gaming Room developed a game based off of the classic television series named "Draw It or Lose It". It is a team-gameplay focused game with strategic elements. When developing the documentation, I had to outline clear and concise requirements like architecture and design constraints. I had to make sure the code implementation closely aligned with these different requirements. If I had to revise my work, I would add more detail and explain my considerations and analysis even further. Focusing on user needs is essential to make sure the product is functional and meets the requirements. When designing software, I adopt an iterative approach, breaking work into chunks while focusing on user needs. This includes story-mapping and prototyping. In future projects I plan to leverage new technologies to enhance my design process.
